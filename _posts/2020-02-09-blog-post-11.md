Duality shows up naturally and elegantly in measure theory, functional analysis, and mathematical optimization. In this post, I have tried to learn and explore the nature of duality via Dual spaces, its interpretation in general linear algebra, all of which was motivated by the so called _convex conjugate_, or the _Fenchel conjugate_ in mathematical optimization.

For the sake of abstractness and general applicability, we will consider that we are in a general field $\Field$ which for example can be $\R$, $\Complex$ etc. Our space of vectors, is the vector space $\Vcal$, which in general can be subspace of $\Field^d$ for some $d\in\Natural$ for example.

# Dual spaces

> **Dual space** - The {\em dual space} $\Vcal^{\*}$ of the vector space $\Vcal$, is the set of all linear transformations $f$ from $\Vcal$ to $\Field$ denoted as $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\Vcal,\Field)$.

> **Linear functionals** - An element $f:\Vcal\to\Field$ of $\Vcal^{\*}$ is called a {\em linear functional}, which takes in a vector $x\in\Vcal$, and outputs an element in $\Field$.

Note that if $f,g\in\Vcal^{\*}$, then $\alpha f + \beta g$ is also in $\Vcal^{\*}$ for $\alpha,\beta\in\Field$ and would be defined as $(\alpha f + \beta g)(x) = \alpha f(x) + \beta g(x)$ for all $x\in\Vcal$. Let us look at a few examples :
1. If $\Vcal = \Pcal_n$ is the space of all univariate polynomial over the field $\R$ with degree $n\in\Natural$, then $f$ defined as $f(p) = p(1)+2p'(0)$, is a linear functional contained in $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\Pcal_n,\R)$.
2. If $\Vcal = \Rd{m\times n}$ be the space of all real matrices of size $m\times n$, then $f$ defined as $f(\M) = \Tr{\M}$, is a linear functional contained in $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\Rd{m\times n},\R)$.
3. If $\Vcal = \Ccal\round{\squarebrack{-\pi,\pi}}$ is the space of all real valued continuous functions on $\squarebrack{-\pi,\pi}$, then $f$ defined as $f(g) = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} g(x)\cos(2x)dx$, is a linear functional contained in $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\squarebrack{-\pi,\pi},\R)$. This function essentially outputs the 2<sup>nd</sup> Fourier coefficient of its input function.

# Dual basis

Let $\Vcal^{\*}$ be a finite dimensional vector space, and $\beta = \curly{v_i}\_{i=1}^n$ be a basis of $\Vcal$. Therefore, for to determine the action of any linear functional $f\in\Vcal^{\*}$, it is enough to know it action on the basis vectors $\curly{v_i}\_{i=1}^n$, i.e., it is enough to know what $\curly{f(v_i)\in\Field}\_{i=1}^n$ are.

> **Dual basis** - If $\Vcal$ is finite dimensional and $\beta = \curly{v_i}\_{i=1}^n$ is a basis of $\Vcal$, then $\beta^{\*} = \curly{f_i}\_{i=1}^n$, the set of functionals defined by $f_i(v_j) = \delta_{ij}\ \forall\ i,j\in\squarebrack{n}$, is the corresponding basis of $\Vcal^{\*}$ also known as a dual basis of $\Vcal$.

To verify that $\beta^{\*}$ is indeed a basis of $\Vcal^{\*}$, we just need to check the following 
1. $\beta^{\*}$ is a linearly independent set of linear functionals, i.e., if $\sumi{1}{n}a_if_i = f_0$ for some set $\{a_j\in\Field\}\_{j=1}^n$, then $a_j=0\ \forall\ j\in\squarebrack{n}$, where is $f_0$ is the $0$ functional. To verify this, we just need to check this condition for all the basis elements of $\Vcal$, $v \in\beta$, which gives us $\sumi{1}{n}a_if_i(v_j) = 0\ \forall\ j \in\squarebrack{n}$, and implies that $a_j = 0\ \forall\ j \in\squarebrack{n}$ establishing the linear independence of the set $\beta^{\*}$.
2. $\beta^{\*}$ spans $\Vcal^{\*}$, i.e., for any $f\in\Vcal^{\*}$, we have some set of elements $\curly{a_j\in\Field}\_{j=1}^n$ such that $f(v) = \sumi{1}{n}a_if_i(v)\ \forall\ v\in\Vcal$. To check this, we evaluate $f$ on basis vectors $v_j\in\beta$ for $j\in\squarebrack{n}$, which gives us $f(v_j) = \sumi{1}{n}a_if_i(v_j) = \sumi{1}{n}a_i\delta_{ij} = a_j\ \forall\ j\in\squarebrack{n}$, or, $a_j = f(v_j)\ \forall\ j \in\squarebrack{n}$. Therefore, if $f$ is in the span of $\beta^{\*}$, then it must be the case that the coefficients $a_j=f(v_j)\ \forall\ j \in \squarebrack{n}$. Now, if $g = \sumi{1}{n}f(v_i)f_i$, then to show that $g=f$, it is enough to show that they agree on the basis vectors $\curly{v_j}$ of $\Vcal$, that is $f(v_i)=g(v_i)$. This is simply true by the construction of $\curly{f_i}\_{i=1}^n$, therefore $\beta^{\*}$ spans $\Vcal^{\*}$.

This establishes that $\beta^{\*} = \curly{f_i}$ is indeed a basis of $\Vcal^{\*}$, and any $f\in\Vcal^{\*}$ can be decomposed into the basis of $\Vcal^{\*}$ as 

>
> $$
> \begin{equation}
> f = \sumi{1}{n}f(v_i)f_i
> \end{equation}
> $$

where $\beta = \curly{v_i}$ is the basis of $\Vcal$. The existence of dual basis $\beta^{\*}$ and the relation with $\beta$ also shows that $\Vcal$ and $\Vcal^{\*}$ are isomorphic.

# Transpose

The existence of the dual basis $\beta^{\*}$ helps us define the concept of _transpose_ in linear algebra which is extensively used application.

> **Transpose** - Let $T:\Vcal\to\Wcal$ be a linear transformation from the vector space $\Vcal$ to the vector space $\Wcal$, then $T^\top:\Wcal^{\*}\to\Vcal^{\*}$ is a linear transformation from $\Wcal^{\*}$ to $\Vcal^{\*}$ that takes in a linear functional $g\in\Wcal^{\*}$, and outputs another linear functional $T^\top(g)\in\Vcal^{\*}$ defined as $T^\top(g)(x) = g\round{T(x)}\ \forall\ x\in\Vcal$.

<div>
$$
\begin{align}
x &\xrightarrow{T} T(x) &\xrightarrow{g\in\Wcal^*}& g(T(x)) &\qquad\equiv\qquad& x &\xrightarrow{T^\top(g)\in\Vcal^*} g(T(x))\\
\Vcal &\xrightarrow{T}\Wcal &\xrightarrow{g\in\Wcal^*}& \Field &\qquad\qquad& \Vcal &\xrightarrow{T^\top(g)\in\Vcal^*} \Field
\end{align}
$$
</div>

> **Theorem** - Let $T:\Vcal\to\Wcal$ be a linear transformation from vector space $\Vcal$ to vector space $\Wcal$. Let $\beta = \curly{v_i}\_{i=1}^n$ and $\beta^{\*} = \curly{f_i}\_{i=1}^n$ be the basis of $\Vcal$ and $\Vcal^{\*}$ respectively, and $\gamma = \curly{w_j}\_{j=1}^m$ and $\gamma^{\*} = \curly{g_j}\_{j=1}^m$ be the basis of $\Wcal$ and $\Wcal^{\*}$ respectively. Let $A = \squarebrack{T}\_{\beta}^\gamma$ be the matrix which transforms a vector in $\Vcal$ to a vector in $\Wcal$. Then $\squarebrack{T^\top}\_{\gamma^{\*}}^{\beta^{\*}}=A^\top$.

The matrix of $\squarebrack{T^\top}\_{\gamma^{\*}}^{\beta^{\*}}$ takes in an element of $\Wcal^{\*}$ represented in its basis $\gamma^{\*}$, and outputs an element in $\Vcal^{\*}$ represented in its basis $\beta^{\*}$. Therefore, it is sufficient to represent every element in $\curly{T^\top(g_j)}\_{j=1}^m$ in the basis $\beta^{\*}$ of $\Vcal^{\*}$. Since any vector $f$ in $\Vcal^{\*}$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors $\beta^{\*}$ as we proved earlier, we have

<div>
$$
\begin{align}
T^\top(g_j) &= \sumi{1}{n}T^\top(g_j)(v_i)f_i\\
&= \sumi{1}{n}g_j(T(v_i))f_i
\end{align}
$$
</div>

Therefore, the $(i,j)$-th element of the matrix $\squarebrack{T^\top}\_{\gamma^{\*}}^{\beta^{\*}}$ is $g_j(T(v_i))$. Now, the elements of the matrix $\squarebrack{T}\_{\beta}^{\gamma}$ are the representations of the basis vectors $\beta$ of $\Vcal$, in the basis vectors $\gamma$ of $\Wcal$. Therefore we have,
<div>
$$
\begin{align}
T(v_i) &= \sumk{1}{m}A_{ki}w_k\\
\implies g_j(T(v_i)) &= g_j\round{\sumk{1}{m}A_{ki}w_k}\\
&= \sumk{1}{m}A_{ki}g_j(w_k)\qquad(\because g \text{ is a linear functional})\\
&= A_{ji}\qquad(\because g_j(w_k)=\delta_{jk})
\end{align}
$$
</div>
Which finally gives us
<div>
$$
\begin{align}
T^\top(g_j) &= \sumi{1}{n}A_{ji}f_i
\end{align}
$$
</div>
and shows us that the $(i,j)$-th element of the matrix $\squarebrack{T^\top}\_{\gamma^{\*}}^{\beta^{\*}}$ is nothing but the $(j,i)$-th element of $A$, which implies that the matrix $\squarebrack{T^\top}\_{\gamma^{\*}}^{\beta^{\*}} = A^\top$.







With this formalization, one can reason about the mathematical object, Fenchel conjugate in an elegant way. Let us first define what a Fenchel conjugate of a function is.

> **Fenchel conjugate** - Let $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\Vcal,\Field)$ be the dual space of $\Vcal$, and $\inner{\ \cdot\ ,\ \cdot\ } : \Vcal^{\*} \times \Vcal \to \Field$ denote the dual pairing between the two vector spaces. For a function $f : \Vcal\to \R\cup\curly{-\infty,\infty}$, its convex conjugate $f^{\*} : \Vcal^{\*}\to \R\cup\curly{-\infty,\infty}$ is defined as
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation}
> f^{*}(g) = \sup\limits_{\x\in\Vcal}\curly{\inner{g,\x} - f(\x)} \qquad \forall\ g\in\Vcal^{*}
> \end{equation}
> $$

For a differentiable function $f:\Vcal\to\Field$, we have from the Taylor's expansion that $\nabla f(\x)$ is a linear functional for all $\x\in\Vcal$, and therefore lies in the dual space $\Vcal^{\*}$. If $f^{\*}:\Vcal^{\*}\to\Field$ is the convex conjugate of $f$, we have that $\nabla f^{\*}(g)$ is an element in $\Vcal^{\*\*}$ for all $g\in\Vcal^{\*}$. Since there exists a natural isomorphism $\Psi : \Vcal\to\Vcal^{\*\*}$ between $\Vcal$ and $\Vcal^{\*\*}$ which is the evaluation map, this in particular gives us $\Psi(\x) = \hat{\x} = \nabla f^{\*}\round{\nabla f(\x)}\in\Vcal^{\*\*}$.
