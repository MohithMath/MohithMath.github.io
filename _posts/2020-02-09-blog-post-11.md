excerpt: "Dual spaces lie at the core of linear algebra and allows us to formally reason about the concept of duality in mathematics. Duality shows up naturally and elegantly in measure theory, functional analysis, and mathematical optimization. In this post, I have tried to learn and explore the nature of duality via Dual spaces, its interpretation in general linear algebra, all of which was motivated by the so called _convex conjugate_, or the _Fenchel conjugate_ in mathematical optimization."

Duality shows up naturally and elegantly in measure theory, functional analysis, and mathematical optimization. In this post, I have tried to learn and explore the nature of duality via Dual spaces, its interpretation in general linear algebra, all of which was motivated by the so called _convex conjugate_, or the _Fenchel conjugate_ in mathematical optimization.

An introduction to Dual spaces, Dual basis, Transposition, and higher order Dual spaces has been covered via a note which can be found [here](\files\DualSpaces.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

With this formalization, one can reason about the mathematical object, Fenchel conjugate in an elegant way. Let us first define what a Fenchel conjugate of a function is.

> **Fenchel conjugate** - Let $\Vcal$ be a vector space, and $\Vcal^* = \mathscr{L}(\Vcal,\Field)$ be its corresponding dual space, and $\inner{\ \cdot\ ,\ \cdot\ } : \Vcal^* \times \Vcal \to \Field$ denote the dual pairing between the two vector spaces. For a function $f : \Vcal\to \R\cup\curly{-\infty,\infty}$, its convex conjugate $f^* : \Vcal^*\to \R\cup\curly{-\infty,\infty}$ is defined as

> f^*(g) \coloneqq \sup\limits_{\x\in\Vcal}\curly{\inner{g,\x} - f(x)}
