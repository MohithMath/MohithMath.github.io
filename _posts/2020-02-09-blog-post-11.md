Duality shows up naturally and elegantly in measure theory, functional analysis, and mathematical optimization. In this post, I have tried to learn and explore the nature of duality via Dual spaces, its interpretation in general linear algebra, all of which was motivated by the so called _convex conjugate_, or the _Fenchel conjugate_ in mathematical optimization.

We shall work over a general vector space $\Vcal$, and a general field $\Field$. For simplicity, $\Vcal$ can be though of as $\Rd{n}$ for some $n\in\Natural$, and $\Field = \R$.
An introduction to Dual spaces, Dual basis, Transposition, and higher order Dual spaces has been covered via a note which can be found [here](\files\DualSpaces.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

With this formalization, one can reason about the mathematical object, Fenchel conjugate in an elegant way. Let us first define what a Fenchel conjugate of a function is.

> **Fenchel conjugate** - Let $\Vcal^* = \mathscr{L}(\Vcal,\Field)$ be the dual space of $\Vcal$, and $\inner{\ \cdot\ ,\ \cdot\ } : \Vcal^* \times \Vcal \to \Field$ denote the dual pairing between the two vector spaces. For a function $f : \Vcal\to \R\cup\curly{-\infty,\infty}$, its convex conjugate $f^* : \Vcal^*\to \R\cup\curly{-\infty,\infty}$ is defined as

For a differentiable function $f:\Vcal\to\Field$, we have from the Taylor's expansion that $\nabla f(\x)$ is a linear functional for all $\x\in\Vcal$, and therefore lies in the dual space $\Vcal^*$. Let $g_\x = \nabla f(\x)$ denote this linear functional. If $f^*:\Vcal^*\to\Field$ is the convex conjugate of $f$, we have that $\nabla f^*(g)$ is an element in $\Vcal^{*\*}$ for all $g\in\Vcal^*$, and in particular $f^*(g_\x)\in\Vcal^{*\*}$.
