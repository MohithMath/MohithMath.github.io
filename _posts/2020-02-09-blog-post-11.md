Duality shows up naturally and elegantly in measure theory, functional analysis, and mathematical optimization. In this post, I have tried to learn and explore the nature of duality via Dual spaces, its interpretation in general linear algebra, all of which was motivated by the so called _convex conjugate_, or the _Fenchel conjugate_ in mathematical optimization.

For the sake of abstractness and general applicability, we will consider that we are in a general field $\Field$ which for example can be $\R$, $\Complex$ etc. Our space of vectors, is the vector space $\Vcal$, which in general can be subspace of $\Field^d$ for some $d\in\Natural$ for example.

# Dual spaces

> **Dual space** - The {\em dual space} $\Vcal^{\*}$ of the vector space $\Vcal$, is the set of all linear transformations $f$ from $\Vcal$ to $\Field$ denoted as $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\Vcal,\Field)$.

> **Linear functionals** - An element $f:\Vcal\to\Field$ of $\Vcal^{\*}$ is called a {\em linear functional}, which takes in a vector $x\in\Vcal$, and outputs an element in $\Field$.

Note that if $f,g\in\Vcal^{\*}$, then $\alpha f + \beta g$ is also in $\Vcal^{\*}$ for $\alpha,\beta\in\Field$ and would be defined as $(\alpha f + \beta g)(x) = \alpha f(x) + \beta g(x)$ for all $x\in\Vcal$. Let us look at a few examples :
1. If $\Vcal = \Pcal_n$ is the space of all univariate polynomial over the field $\R$ with degree $n\in\Natural$, then $f$ defined as $f(p) = p(1)+2p'(0)$, is a linear functional contained in $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\Pcal_n,\R)$.
2. If $\Vcal = \Rd{m\times n}$ be the space of all real matrices of size $m\times n$, then $f$ defined as $f(\M) = \Tr{\M}$, is a linear functional contained in $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\Rd{m\times n},\R)$.
3. If $\Vcal = \Ccal\round{\squarebrack{-\pi,\pi}}$ is the space of all real valued continuous functions on $\squarebrack{-\pi,\pi}$, then $f$ defined as $f(g) = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} g(x)\cos(2x)dx$, is a linear functional contained in $\Vcal^{\*} = \mathscr{L}(\squarebrack{-\pi,\pi},\R)$. This function essentially outputs the 2<sup>nd</sup>> Fourier coefficient of its input function.

# Dual basis












With this formalization, one can reason about the mathematical object, Fenchel conjugate in an elegant way. Let us first define what a Fenchel conjugate of a function is.

> **Fenchel conjugate** - Let $\Vcal^* = \mathscr{L}(\Vcal,\Field)$ be the dual space of $\Vcal$, and $\inner{\ \cdot\ ,\ \cdot\ } : \Vcal^* \times \Vcal \to \Field$ denote the dual pairing between the two vector spaces. For a function $f : \Vcal\to \R\cup\curly{-\infty,\infty}$, its convex conjugate $f^* : \Vcal^*\to \R\cup\curly{-\infty,\infty}$ is defined as
> 
> $$
> \begin{equation}
> f^*(g) = \sup\limits_{\x\in\Vcal}\curly{\inner{g,\x} - f(\x)} \qquad \forall\ g\in\Vcal^*
> \end{equation}
> $$

For a differentiable function $f:\Vcal\to\Field$, we have from the Taylor's expansion that $\nabla f(\x)$ is a linear functional for all $\x\in\Vcal$, and therefore lies in the dual space $\Vcal^{\*}$. If $f^{\*}:\Vcal^{\*}\to\Field$ is the convex conjugate of $f$, we have that $\nabla f^{\*}(g)$ is an element in $\Vcal^{\*\*}$ for all $g\in\Vcal^{\*}$. Since there exists a natural isomorphism $\Psi : \Vcal\to\Vcal^{\*\*}$ between $\Vcal$ and $\Vcal^{\*\*}$ which is the evaluation map, this in particular gives us $\Psi(\x) = \hat{\x} = \nabla f^{\*}\round{\nabla f(\x)}\in\Vcal^{\*\*}$.
