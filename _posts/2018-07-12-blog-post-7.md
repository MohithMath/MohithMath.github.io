excerpt: 'This article is in continuation of my [previous blog](https://raghavsomani.github.io/posts/2018/04/blog-post-6/), and discusses about the work by [Prateek Jain, Dheeraj Nagaraj and Praneeth Netrapalli 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01463.pdf){:target="_blank"} which attempts to answer Léon Bottou's (2009) open question of understanding SGD without replacement. The authors provide tight rates for SGD without repacement for general smooth, and general smooth and strongly convex functions using method of exchangable pairs to bound Wasserstein distances, and techniques from optimal transport.'

This article is in continuation of my [previous blog](https://raghavsomani.github.io/posts/2018/04/blog-post-6/), and discusses about the work by [Prateek Jain, Dheeraj Nagaraj and Praneeth Netrapalli 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.01463.pdf){:target="_blank"} which attempts to answer Léon Bottou's (2009) open question of understanding SGD without replacement. The authors provide tight rates for SGD without repacement for general smooth, and general smooth and strongly convex functions using method of exchangable pairs to bound Wasserstein distances, and techniques from optimal transport. They show that SGD without replacement on general smooth and strongly convex functions can achieve a rate of $$\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{1}{K^2} \right)$$ where $$K$$ is the number of passes over the data when $K\in\mathcal{\Omega}(\kappa^2)$ where $\kappa$ is the condition number of the problem. This is strictly better than SGD with replacement which has a rate of $$\mathcal{O}\left( \frac{1}{K} \right)$$ in the similar setting. Their analysis does not require the Hessian Lipschitz condition and holds for any general smooth and srongly convex function. They also show that SGD without replacement is at least as good as SGD with replacement for general smooth convex functions in the absence of strong convexity.
