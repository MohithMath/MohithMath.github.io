Worked on modelling a Policy Uncertainty Index for India using newspaper media. Used Machine Learning tools like Soft Margin Support Vector Machines and Kernel methods. Came up with an index that had correlations of 0.61 with Indian VIX just using text articles. We were also able to detect important national events like terrorism, political elections, economic crisis, etc.
