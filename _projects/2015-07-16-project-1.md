Worked on modelling a Policy Uncertainty Index for India using newspaper media. Used Machine Learning tools like Soft Margin Support Vector Machines and Kernel methods. Data was collected by web scraping the Hindu newspaper for the period of 4 years. The processed text was fed to the soft margin RBF Kernel SVM classifier after data transformation and feature selection. We read 1100 newspaper articles and tested over 47875 remaining articles. The resulting index after normalization was compared with scores like Volatility Index (VIX) and the past Government Securities to give significant correlations. We came up with an index that had correlations of 0.61 with Indian VIX just using text articles. We were also able to detect important national events like terrorism, political elections, economic crisis, etc.
