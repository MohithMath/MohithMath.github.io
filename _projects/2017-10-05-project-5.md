{% include_relative macros/macros.md %}We study the problem of Sparse Regression, a landmark problem in the domain of Machine Learning, Statistics and Optimization which finds numerous applications in Compressed Sensing, model compression, high dimensional statistics, bio-informatics, [resource constrained machine learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/resource-efficient-ml-for-the-edge-and-endpoint-iot-devices/){:target="_blank"} and more. Sparse Regression can be written down as an optimization problem as

$$
\x + \y = \z\\
\A_\Sset\\
\etavec+\vvec\\
\cond{s}\\
\infnorm{\A\x}
$$
