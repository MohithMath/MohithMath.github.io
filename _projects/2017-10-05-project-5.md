{% include_relative macros/macros_project5.md %}We study the problem of Sparse Regression, a landmark problem in the domain of Machine Learning, Statistics and Optimization which finds numerous applications in Compressed Sensing, model compression, high dimensional statistics, bio-informatics, [resource constrained machine learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/resource-efficient-ml-for-the-edge-and-endpoint-iot-devices/){:target="_blank"} and more. Sparse Regression can be written down as an optimization problem as
\[
\xbar = \argmin\limits_{\lznorm{\x}\leq s^*} f(\x)
\]
where $$\x\in\Rd{d}$$ and $$s^*<< d$$, the ambient dimension
