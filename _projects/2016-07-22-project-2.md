Most recommendation engines force raters to map their natural rating scales, which might vary across the raters, to an arbitrary scale e.g. 1-5. We propose Clustered Monotone Transforms for Rating Factorization (CMTRF), which searches for monotonic transformations of the rating scales resulting in a better fit. The model is combined with an underlying matrix factorization regression model that couples the user-wise ratings to exploit shared low dimensional structure. We show that the model recovers a unique solution under mild conditions, and propose three simple and efficient variants, all of which alternate between transformation of the rating scales, and matrix factorization regression. The rating scale transformations can be generated for each user, for a cluster of users, or for all the users at once, forming the basis of the three different algorithms. Empirical results on synthetic and realworld datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed approach.
