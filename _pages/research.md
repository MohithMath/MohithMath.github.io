#### Preprint

* **Conformal Tilings, Combinatorial Curvature, and the Type Problem** \
  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08233" target="_blank" style="color: #527bbd; text-decoration: underline">arXiv:2311.08233</a>] (submitted)

#### Projects

* **Gauge theory and Kapustin-Witten equations** \
  Starting from de Rham and Hodge and continuing into Donaldson, studying the solutions of certain equations over a manifold has yielded valuable information about its topological and smooth structure. The goal of my project is to study the conjectural relationship between the Kapustin-Witten equations and the colored Jones polynomial. So far, I have studied the Yang-Mills equations, the ADHM construction of ASD connections, and Uhlenbeck’s analytic results on gauge fixing and compactness of sequence of Yang-Mills connections. Next, I am studying the Bogomolny equation for magnetic monopoles, Hitchin’s equations, and Seiberg-Witten theory. \
  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08233" target="_blank" style="color: #527bbd; text-decoration: underline">report</a>] - gives a glimpse of Yang-Mills theory and ADHM construction of ASD connections.

* **Conformal tilings of Riemann surfaces** \
  A conformal tiling is a special tiling on a Riemann surface that respects and is constrained by the complex structure of the Riemann surface. I studied the question of which Riemann surfaces admit conformal tilings using regular polygons with the help of quasi-conformal maps and circle packing theory. I answered a special case of the type problem raised by Bowers and Stephenson (2017). \
  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08233" target="_blank" style="color: #527bbd; text-decoration: underline">report</a>] - contains a brief summary about how different Riemann surfaces can and can’t be conformally tiled.\
  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08233" target="_blank" style="color: #527bbd; text-decoration: underline">preprint</a>] - discusses the relationship between combinatorial curvature and the universal cover of the Riemann surface.\
  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08233" target="_blank" style="color: #527bbd; text-decoration: underline">slides</a>] - introduces conformal tilings using examples and properties.

* **Complex dynamics** \
  Complex dynamics is the study of the dynamics of points on a Riemann surface under the repeated application of a holomorphic map. I studied local fixed point theory (dynamics of points near a fixed point) and global theory (properties and characteristics of sets of points with similar dynamics) from Milnor's book, 'Dynamics in One Complex Variable.’.\
  [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08233" target="_blank" style="color: #527bbd; text-decoration: underline">slides</a>] - contains a glimpse into complex dynamics and discusses Koenigs linearization.
 
* **Riemann surfaces and the uniformization theorem** \
  A Riemann surface is a surface whose transition maps are biholomorphic. Two Riemann surfaces that are topologically the same can be very different as Riemann surfaces. I studied the collection (moduli space) of all Riemann surfaces homeomorphic to the torus and the uniformization theorem which states that every Riemann surface is one of three types. To prove the uniformization theorem, I learnt several techniques from PDE and functional analysis.\
