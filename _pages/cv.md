Research Interests
------
My first encounter with Machine Learning was during the project ([link](https://dbp1994.github.io/projects/2018-11-03-project){:target="_blank"}) I worked on at SPIRE lab. However, I have shifted my focus to theoretical machine learning and my current research interest is in _robust supervised learning_ in the presence of _label noise_.
