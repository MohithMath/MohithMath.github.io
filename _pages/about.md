I am a first year Masters student at the [Department of Mathematics](https://cs.wisc.edu){:target="_blank"}, Indian Institute of Science (IISc). I am broadly interested in geometry, topology, and complex analysis. Currently, I am focusing on gauge theory with the goal of studying the Kapustin-Witten equations.

Previously, I worked on conformal tilings and their existence on Riemann surfaces.

Before that, I spent a year as a Project Assistant at [SPIRE Lab, IISc](https://spire.ee.iisc.ac.in/spire/){:target="_blank"} where I was advised by [Prof. Prasanta Kumar Ghosh](https://ee.iisc.ac.in/prasanta-kumar-ghosh/){:target="_blank"} on speech-based automated disease onset detection and severity prediction of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson's Disease.

Contact me at `mohithraju[at]iisc[dot]ac.in`.
<!--- I am also exploring the robustness properties of mammalian vision-inspired feedback mechanisms for deep neural networks. --->
