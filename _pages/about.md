I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research, India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} and I am mentored by [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/){:target="_blank"}. I am a part of the [Provable Non-convex Optimization for Machine Learning Problems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/provable-non-convex-optimization-for-machine-learning-problems/){:target="_blank"} project group.

I am interested in aspects of Large-Scale Optimization, Random Matrix theory, Statistical Learning theory that arise in fundamental Machine Learning problems.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017. I have worked on Recommendation system applications with [Prof. Arabin Kumar Dey](http://www.iitg.ac.in/arabin/) for my undergraduate thesis.

I am also interested in High dimensional geometry, Statistics, Analysis and areas that involve geometric thinking. I aspire to pursue the areas of my interest through a Ph.D. and then work in Research and Development to contribute to the Scientific and Technological community.
