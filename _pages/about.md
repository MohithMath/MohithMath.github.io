I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} mentored by [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/){:target="_blank"}.

My interests are in aspects of Large-Scale Optimization and Probability theory that arises in fundamental Machine Learning problems.

Currently, I am trying to understand the training dynamics of simple Neural Networks from the lenses of variational calculus. Other topic that have caught my recent attention are Gradient flows in the space of probability measures and Manifold Optimization. I am also interested in High dimensional geometry, Statistics, Analysis and areas that require geometric thinking.

Previously, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017. During my undergraduate studies, I have worked on Recommendation systems and Text classification.

I will be joining [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} as a graduate student from Fall 2019. You can find my resume [here](\files\Raghav_CV_MSR.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
