I am a Research Fellow at in the [Machine Learning and Optimization group (India)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-and-optimization/) at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/). I am a fresh [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php) graduate from [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/).
I am interested in Machine Learning and Optimization. During my undergraduate studies I have worked on its applied areas, and now with my growing interest, I have started to look at the theoretical aspects of Machine Learning and Data Science that include mathematical analysis in Optimization, fundamental Matrix theory, Probability and related areas in Mathematics.
Apart from Machine Learning, I am also interested in Scientific Computing, Statistics, Measure Theory, Analysis and areas that involve geometric thinking.
I aspire to pursue the areas of my interest through a Ph.D. and then work in Research and Development to contribute to the Scientific and Technological community.
