I will be joining [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} as a PhD student from Fall 2019.

I am broadly interested in the aspects of Large-Scale Optimization and Probability theory that arise in fundamental Machine Learning. Other topic that have caught my recent attention are Gradient flows in the space of probability measures and Manifold Optimization. I am also interested in High dimensional geometry, Statistics, Analysis and Physical sciences.

Previously, I spent two wonderful years as a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/){:target="_blank"} on provable non-convex optimization algorithms for Machine Learning and understanding several phenomena in Neural Networks. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017.
