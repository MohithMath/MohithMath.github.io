I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} mentored by [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/){:target="_blank"}. My interests are in aspects of Large-Scale Optimization and Probability theory that arises in fundamental Machine Learning problems.

Currently, I am trying to understand the training dynamics of simple Neural Networks. Other topic that have caught my recent attention are Gradient flows in the space of probability measures and Manifold Optimization. I am also interested in High dimensional geometry, Statistics, Analysis and Physical sciences.

Previously, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017.


I will be joining [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} as a graduate student from Fall 2019. You can find my resume [here](\files\Raghav_CV_MSR.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
