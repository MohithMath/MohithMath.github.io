I am a Research Fellow at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} mentored by [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/){:target="_blank"}. I am a part of the [Provable Non-convex Optimization for Machine Learning Problems](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/provable-non-convex-optimization-for-machine-learning-problems/){:target="_blank"} project group.

My interests are in aspects of Large-Scale Optimization, Random Matrix theory and Statistical Learning theory that arises in fundamental Machine Learning problems.

A recent work, [Support Recovery for Orthogonal Matching Pursuit: Upper and Lower bounds](https://raghavsomani.github.io/publication/2018-09-05-OMP-2){:target="_blank"} with my co-authors has been accepted has for a *Spotlight* presentation at the [*NIPS 2018*](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/){:target="_blank"}. I am currently working on the problem of generalization in simple Neural Networks under geometric assumptions of the data.

Previously, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017. I have worked on Recommendation systems with [Prof. Arabin Kumar Dey](http://www.iitg.ac.in/arabin/) for my undergraduate thesis.

I am also interested in High dimensional geometry, Statistics, Analysis and areas that require geometric thinking. I aspire to pursue the areas of my interest through a Ph.D.
