I am an incoming CS PhD stdudent at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

I am broadly interested in the aspects of Large-Scale Optimization and Probability theory that arise in fundamental Machine Learning. Related topic that have caught my recent attention are Stochastic gradient flow/descent on non-convex landscapes, Gradient flows in the space of probability measures and Manifold Optimization. I am also interested in High dimensional geometry, Statistics, Analysis and Physical sciences.

Previously, I spent two wonderful years as a [Research Fellow](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/research-fellow-program/?#){:target="_blank"} at [Microsoft Research Lab - India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/){:target="_blank"} where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Praneeth Netrapalli](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/praneeth/){:target="_blank"} and [Dr. Prateek Jain](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/prajain/){:target="_blank"} on provable non-convex optimization algorithms for Machine Learning and understanding several phenomena in Deep learning. Prior to the fellowship, I attended [IIT Guwahati](http://www.iitg.ernet.in/){:target="_blank"} where I obtained my B.Tech. in [Mathematics and Computing](https://www.iitg.ernet.in/maths/acads/btech_struct.php){:target="_blank"} in 2017.
